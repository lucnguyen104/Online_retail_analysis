Customer segmentation is the technique of dividing customers into groups based on their purchase patterns to identify who are the most profitable groups. In segmenting customers, various criteria can also be used depending on the market such as geographic, demographic characteristics or behavior bases, etc. There are so many techniques out there but I will use RFM analysis for my analysis.

What is RFM?

RFM is an acronym for recency, frequency, and monetary. 
Recency is about when was the last order of a customer. It means the number of days since a customer made the last purchase. If itâ€™s a case for a website or an app, this could be interpreted as the last visit day or the last login time.
Frequency is about the number of purchases in a given period. It could be 3 months, 6 months or 1 year. So we can understand this value as to how often or how many a customer used the product of a company. The bigger the value is, the more engaged the customers are. Could we say them as our VIP? Not necessary. Cause we also have to think about how much they actually paid for each purchase, which means monetary value.
Monetary is the total amount of money a customer spent in that given period. Therefore big spenders will be differentiated from other customers such as MVPs or VIPs.

Business requirements

The Sales Manager wants me to segment customers into 4 levels: VIP, Normal, Low, and Extremely Low. The purpose of the Sales Manager when requesting me to do that because not only does he want to better understand customers but he also wants to give some attractive endowments to retain the customers based on their level.
